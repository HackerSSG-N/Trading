## 1. Buy Limit
- 👉 Buy **below** the current price because you think price will **fall and bounce up**.  
- **Example:**  
  - Current Price = 1930  
  - Buy Limit = 1925  
  - Expectation: price falls → hits 1925 → then goes **up** ✅  

---

## 2. Sell Limit
- 👉 Sell **above** the current price because you think price will **rise and drop down**.  
- **Example:**  
  - Current Price = 1930  
  - Sell Limit = 1935  
  - Expectation: price rises → hits 1935 → then goes **down** ✅  

---

## 3. Buy Stop
- 👉 Buy **above** the current price because you think price will **keep going up (breakout)**.  
- **Example:**  
  - Current Price = 1930  
  - Buy Stop = 1935  
  - Expectation: price breaks 1935 → continues **up** ✅  

---

## 4. Sell Stop
- 👉 Sell **below** the current price because you think price will **keep going down (breakout)**.  
- **Example:**  
  - Current Price = 1930  
  - Sell Stop = 1925  
  - Expectation: price breaks 1925 → continues **down** ✅

## 5. Buy Stop Limit
- 👉 Buy **above** the current price (breakout), but only if you get it at your limit price or cheaper.  
- **Example:**  
  - Current Price = 1930  
  - Stop = 1935 (trigger)  
  - Limit = 1936 (maximum price you agree to pay)  
  - Expectation: if price reaches 1935, a Buy Limit at 1936 is placed.  
  - If price jumps directly to 1937, order **will not execute** ❌  

---

## 6. Sell Stop Limit
- 👉 Sell **below** the current price (breakout), but only if you get it at your limit price or better.  
- **Example:**  
  - Current Price = 1930  
  - Stop = 1925 (trigger)  
  - Limit = 1924 (lowest price you agree to sell at)  
  - Expectation: if price hits 1925, a Sell Limit at 1924 is placed.  
  - If price drops directly to 1923, order **will not execute** ❌

# ✅ Memory Trick
- **Limit = Reversal** → Buy low, Sell high.  
- **Stop = Breakout** → Buy high, Sell low.  
- **Stop Limit = Breakout + Control** → You want breakout entry, but only at a controlled price.
