# ðŸ“Œ Forex/Gold (XAU/USD) Trading Basics: Spread & Slippage

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Spread

### What is Spread?
- Spread = difference between the **Buy (Ask)** price and **Sell (Bid)** price.  
- Itâ€™s the brokerâ€™s fee (their profit).  

### Example with Gold (XAU/USD)
- **Bid (Sell)** = 1930.20  
- **Ask (Buy)** = 1930.70  
- **Spread = 1930.70 â€“ 1930.20 = $0.50**  

ðŸ‘‰ If you trade **1 lot (100 oz)**:  
100 oz Ã— $0.50 = $50 cost instantly


### Impact of Spread
- You start every trade in a small loss equal to the spread.  
- **Short-term scalpers** are affected most.  
- **Swing/long-term traders** usually donâ€™t care much.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Slippage

### What is Slippage?
- Slippage = when your order is executed at a **different price than expected**.  
- Happens in **fast-moving** or **low-liquidity** markets (gold is very volatile).  

**Formula:**
Slippage = Executed Price â€“ Expected Price


### Example 1: Buy Order (Entry)
- Expected Buy = 1935.00  
- Actual Fill = 1936.20  
- Slippage = **$1.20 higher**  

ðŸ’° Cost for 1 lot (100 oz):  

100 Ã— $1.20 = $120 lost instantly


### Example 2: Stop Loss (Exit)
- SL set at = 1930.00  
- Market gaps to = 1929.00  
- Slippage = **$1 lower**  

ðŸ’° Extra Loss for 1 lot (100 oz):  

100 Ã— $1 = $100 more loss


### Positive Slippage (Rare but Possible)
- Expected Sell = 1930.00  
- Actual Fill = 1931.00  
- Profit = $1 Ã— 100 = **$100 extra gain** âœ…

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- **Spread** = brokerâ€™s fee (built into prices). Always applies.  
- **Slippage** = market condition effect (fast moves / gaps). Not always, but possible.  
- Both **eat into profits or increase losses**.  
- Larger lot size = bigger impact from both.
