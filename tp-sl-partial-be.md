# ðŸ“˜ Trade Management in Forex (Gold â€“ XAU/USD Examples)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Partial Book (Partial Close)
**Definition:**  
Closing part of your trade to lock in profit, while keeping the rest running.

**Example (Gold â€“ XAU/USD):**  
- Entry: **Buy 1 lot @ 1930.00**  
- Price goes to **1935.00**  
- Full profit would be **$500 (5 Ã— $100)**  
- You close **0.50 lot** â†’ Profit = **$250 secured**  
- Remaining **0.50 lot** stays open  

âœ… You have **$250 in pocket** and still a chance for more.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. SL to BE (Stop Loss to Break Even)
**Definition:**  
Moving your Stop Loss to your entry point so trade becomes risk-free.

**Example (Gold â€“ XAU/USD):**  
- Entry: **Buy 1 lot @ 1930.00**  
- Initial SL = **1928.00** â†’ Risk = **$200 loss**  
- Price moves to **1935.00** â†’ Unrealized profit = **$500**  
- You move SL to **1930.00 (entry)**  

âœ… Now worst case = **0 profit / 0 loss**, best case = more profit.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. TP (Take Profit)
**Definition:**  
A predefined price level where your trade automatically closes to secure profit.

**Example (Gold â€“ XAU/USD):**  
- Entry: **Buy 1 lot @ 1930.00**  
- TP set @ **1940.00**  
- If price hits TP, trade closes â†’ Profit = **$1,000 (10 Ã— $100)**  

âœ… You donâ€™t need to watch the chart, profit is taken automatically.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Combining Them (Smart Management)
Traders often **use all three** together:

**Example (Gold â€“ XAU/USD):**  
- Entry: **Buy 1 lot @ 1930.00**  
- Price moves to **1935.00**  
  - Partial Close: **0.50 lot closed â†’ $250 secured**  
  - SL of remaining 0.50 lot moved to **1930.00 (BE)** â†’ no risk  
  - TP for remaining 0.50 lot set at **1940.00** â†’ if hit = **$500 extra**  

âœ… Final results:  
- Worst case: Keep **$250 locked**  
- Best case: **$250 + $500 = $750 total profit**
